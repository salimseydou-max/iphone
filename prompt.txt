📱 Cursor Prompt: iPhone App Idea (Expo / React Native)

Role:
You are a senior iOS / React Native engineer building a production-ready iPhone mobile app using Expo + React Native, with clean architecture and modern best practices. The app should be deployable via Vercel (Expo web support) and App Store–ready.

🧠 App Overview

Build an iPhone app that helps users discover and track nearby local events and activities (concerts, meetups, festivals, workshops). The app should allow users to browse events, save favorites, and view event details in a clean, native mobile experience optimized for iOS.

The app should feel fast, minimal, and “Apple-like” in design.

✅ Requirements

Use Expo (React Native) with TypeScript

Target iPhone first (iOS-optimized UI/UX)

Functional components with hooks

Clean folder structure

Environment variable support

Ready for App Store submission (no web-only hacks)

Compatible with Vercel deployment (Expo web)

✨ Features
Core Features

Browse nearby events by category (music, tech, fitness, food, art)

Search events by name or keyword

View event details:

Title

Description

Date & time

Location

Image

Save / unsave events (favorites)

Simple local persistence for favorites (AsyncStorage)

Optional Enhancements

Location-based filtering (city or coordinates)

Dark mode support

Pull-to-refresh event list

Skeleton loaders for better UX

🌐 API

Use an open public events API (or mock data if needed) such as:

Ticketmaster Discovery API

Eventbrite public API

OR a mocked REST API structure if API keys are unavailable

API Expectations

Fetch a list of events

Fetch event details by ID

Handle loading and error states gracefully

Store API keys securely via environment variables

🎨 Styling & UI

iOS-first design principles

Use native-feeling components

Minimal, clean layout inspired by Apple apps

Rounded cards, subtle shadows, smooth transitions

Use:

StyleSheet or styled-components

System fonts (San Francisco style)

Support light & dark mode

🚀 Deployment Readiness

App should run with npx expo start

Expo configuration ready for:

iOS build

Web build (for Vercel)

Environment variables documented

No hardcoded secrets

Clear instructions for:

Local development

Production build

Vercel deployment (Expo web)

📦 Output Expectations

Provide:

Recommended project folder structure

Key screens and components

Example API service file

Example environment variable usage

Any necessary Expo configuration

Clear comments explaining important decisions

Write clean, maintainable, production-quality code with iOS best practices in mind.

If you want, I can:

Tailor this for a different iPhone app idea

Make it AI-powered

Add authentication

Optimize it specifically for App Store review approval
